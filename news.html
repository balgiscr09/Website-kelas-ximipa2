    <h2 style="color:#004aad;font-size:22px;margin-bottom:10px;">Government Launches SIMBARA for Mining Transparency</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>According to Datafaogo Stevanus, RRI Voice of Indonesia (November 5, 2025)</em></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs held the Kick-Off Implementation of Presidential Regulation Number 94 Year 2025 on Integrated Digital Services for Mineral and Coal Commodities (SIMBARA) in Jakarta, Wednesday (10/29/2025). The implementation marks a milestone in strengthening governance and optimizing state revenue from the mineral and coal sector.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">“Through SIMBARA, the government builds an integrated digital service system connecting data, policies, and supervision,” the ministry's Deputy for Energy and Mineral Resources Coordination, Elen Setiadi, conveyed. The system aims to ensure transparency and compliance among business actors in the mineral and coal sector. As quoted by the Ministry's Press Release on Tuesday (11/4/2025), SIMBARA implementation involves not only digital system integration but also cross-sector policy alignment. Each Ministry or Institution is urged to prepare concrete action plans for effective execution.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In 2025, SIMBARA will focus on five main commodities: coal, nickel, tin, bauxite, and copper. The Auto Blocking System will sanction companies violating environmental, forest area, or labor regulations. The initial implementation, since 2022, has improved compliance in state revenue payments. Several ministries support the expansion in 2025, including the Environment, Forestry, Transportation, and Industry ministries.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) includes SIMBARA in Action 8 of the National Strategy of Corruption Prevention for 2025-2026. Bank Indonesia also supports the integration of export foreign exchange supervision within the system. Deputy Elen underscored the need for rapid collaboration among ministries to meet this year’s targets. He also added that technical meetings with four key ministries will finalize SIMBARA’s integration and governance for copper and bauxite commodities.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#004aad;font-size:22px;margin-bottom:10px;">UNESCO Has Designated Raja Ampat as A World Biosphere Reserve</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>According to TEMPO (September 27, 2025)</em></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) designated Raja Ampat as a world biosphere reserve on Saturday, September 27, 2025. The area in Southwest Papua Province is considered to have a marine ecosystem with the highest biodiversity in the world.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Head of the West Papua Natural Resources Conservation Agency, Johny Santoso, stated that Papua's land conservation is strongly supported by the local wisdom of indigenous communities, particularly those in Raja Ampat Regency. "'The forest is mother, the sea is father,' is the spirit of the Raja Ampat people to protect their forests and their seas," he said during the proposal for the Raja Ampat Biosphere Reserve in Waisai on September 24, 2024, as recorded in a UNESCO release received by Tempo.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">According to Johny, there are nine conservation areas in Raja Ampat Regency that are managed collaboratively by indigenous communities, local and central governments, non-governmental organizations, academics, and other stakeholders. These nine areas form the core of the Raja Ampat Biosphere Reserve.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">After being designated a UNESCO Global Geopark in 2023, Raja Ampat is now also recognized as a biosphere reserve. With this dual status, Raja Ampat joins the very limited number of regions worldwide to receive dual UNESCO recognition.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#004aad;font-size:22px;margin-bottom:10px;">Antarctic Glacier’s Rapid Retreat Sparks Scientific ‘Whodunnit’</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>According to Mark Poynting, BBC (November 3, 2025)</em></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When an Antarctic glacier was sparked into rapid retreat three years ago, it left scientists scratching their heads as to what might have caused it. Hektoria Glacier retreated by more than 8km (5 miles) in just two months in late 2022 - and now a new study claims to have the answer. The authors believe that Hektoria could be the first modern example of a process where the front of a glacier resting on the seabed rapidly destabilises.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">That could lead to much faster sea-level rise if it happened elsewhere in Antarctica, they say. But other scientists argue that this part of the glacier was actually floating in the ocean – so while the changes are impressive, they are not so unusual. Floating tongues of glaciers extending into the sea – called ice shelves – are much more prone to breaking up than glacier fronts resting on the seabed. That's because they can be more easily eaten away by warm water underneath.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">That Hektoria has undergone huge change is not contested. Its front retreated by about 25km (16 miles) between January 2022 and March 2023, satellite data shows. But unravelling the causes is like a "whodunnit" mystery, according to study lead author Naomi Ochwat, research affiliate at the University of Colorado Boulder and post-doctoral researcher at the University of Innsbruck.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In just two months, Hektoria retreated by 8.2km — nearly ten times faster than any grounded glacier recorded before. Upward forces from the ocean water could "lift" the thinning ice essentially all at once, they argue - causing icebergs to break off and the glacier to retreat in quick time. "Glaciers don't usually retreat this fast," said co-author Adrian Luckman, professor of geography at Swansea University.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">While researchers debate the mechanisms, all agree on one thing: Antarctica is changing faster than expected. “We must collect more data from satellites so that we can better monitor and understand why these changes are occurring and what their implications are,” said Anna Hogg, professor of Earth observation at the University of Leeds.</p>

  <h2 style="color:#004aad;font-size:22px;margin-bottom:10px;">Indonesia’s Prabowo Signals More Airbus A400M Aircraft Deal</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>According to ANTARA (November 3, 2025)</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Jakarta (ANTARA) – President Prabowo Subianto has indicated the start of negotiations to purchase four additional Airbus A400M transport aircraft after officially handing over Indonesia's first unit to the Air Force (TNI-AU) on Monday.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">The first A400M, bearing tail number A-4001, officially joined the 31st Heavy Transport Squadron at Halim Perdanakusuma Air Force Base in Jakarta. The second unit is expected to arrive in 2026. “We have active contracts for two A400M aircraft. We have options for four more. We may negotiate to sign the purchase of four more,” Prabowo told reporters after inspecting the aircraft.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">The A400M is a multipurpose aircraft capable of heavy cargo transport, aerial refueling, and humanitarian or combat operations. The aircraft can carry up to 37 tons of cargo, including fuel trucks, excavators, and 116 fully equipped personnel. Indonesia has become the 10th A400M operator globally, joining Malaysia, Turkey, and Kazakhstan in Asia.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">To prepare for the aircraft's operation, 22 TNI-AU personnel, including pilots and technicians, have undergone training in Spain with Airbus.</p>

  <h2 style="color:#004aad;font-size:22px;margin-bottom:10px;">Avoiding Fiscal Exhaustion</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>According to A. Prasetyo, Kompas.id (November 4, 2025)</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">One of the debates welcoming the one-year anniversary of the Prabowo Subianto–Gibran Rakabuming administration is whether our fiscal situation remains healthy. Finance Minister Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa claims it is secure. The reason is that the government's budget deficit is still below 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Meanwhile, the ratio of government debt balance is still around 40 percent of GDP, which is well below the legal ceiling of 60 percent. The 3 percent deficit limit and 60 percent debt balance were adopted from the Maastricht Treaty (1992), an agreement among European Union countries when they were about to issue the common currency, the euro. This standard was explicitly formalized by the Government of Indonesia in Law Number 17 of 2003 concerning State Finance.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, this criterion has been abandoned by European Union countries and other developed nations, especially since the onset of the crisis storm, ranging from the global financial crisis (2008) to the Covid-19 pandemic crisis (2020). Now, almost all developed countries have a very large government debt balance ratio and a wide government budget deficit. Japan has become the country with the highest debt-to-GDP ratio in the world, at approximately 230 percent. In Europe, Greece holds the highest record with a debt ratio exceeding 150 percent of GDP. This is followed by Italy, Portugal, and Belgium, with debt ratios ranging from 100 to 140 percent of GDP. Meanwhile, the debt ratio of the United States reaches 124 percent of GDP. Compared to those countries, Indonesia's debt ratio is still very small. However, is our fiscal condition truly secure and sustainable? In 2011, senior economist at the International Monetary Fund, Atish R. Ghosh, popularized the concept of fiscal fatigue as a more detailed indicator of debt's role in increasing economic productivity.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past ten years, the Indonesian government's debt ratio has increased dramatically in line with increased infrastructure spending. In 2014, our debt ratio was still around 30 percent of GDP. By 2024, it had reached 38.8 percent of GDP. The issue is that the increase in the debt ratio is not in line with the increase in investment. The investment ratio to the economy has only slightly risen, from 32.5 percent in 2014 to 33 percent in 2024. This means that the debt ratio has surged by nearly 9 percentage points, while the investment ratio has only increased by 0.5 percentage points. Investment stagnation is accompanied by a decline in manufacturing sector activities. The manufacturing ratio to GDP as an indicator has decreased from 21 percent in 2014 to 18 percent in 2024. In fact, in 2005, the role of the manufacturing sector in the economy once reached 28 percent. Over the past twenty years, the role of the manufacturing sector has declined by approximately 10 percent. Tax revenue has also experienced stagnation. In 2014, the tax-to-GDP ratio reached 11.4 percent. In 2024, the ratio is only 10 percent. In 2008, the tax ratio once reached its highest figure, 13 percent. Of course, this is with the note that there were external factors at the time, such as the commodity boom. Domestic factors such as stagnation in investment and the decline in the role of the manufacturing sector in recent years have been the main contributors to the decrease in state revenue.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Several indicators can identify signs of fiscal exhaustion. First, the primary budget balance, or the difference between revenues and expenditures, excluding debt payments. A positive primary budget balance means the government can pay its debts from revenues. A negative balance means the government needs to issue new debt to service the debt. We once experienced a peak in the primary budget surplus in 2008 at 1.7 percent due to soaring commodity prices. Since 2011, we have begun to experience a primary budget deficit that continues to this day. By 2025, the deficit is projected to reach 0.5 percent of GDP. The Covid-19 pandemic has indeed worsened the quality of our primary budget balance. However, massive infrastructure development, including the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed train (Whoosh) and the new national capital in East Kalimantan, has also made a significant contribution. Second, the ratio of debt interest payments to state revenue. In 2024, the ratio reaches 17 percent. In contrast, in 2014, the ratio was still 8.5 percent. Thus, over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the burden of debt interest payments that has not been accompanied by a sufficient increase in economic capacity and performance. Third, spending rigidity is due to the large number of mandatory spending items. In 2014, mandatory spending accounted for approximately 60 percent. By 2024, the allocation will exceed 70 percent of total annual spending (the state budget). The greater the mandatory spending, the narrower the opportunity to increase dynamic sectoral productivity.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">The Prabowo-Gibran administration inherits a challenging fiscal condition. Therefore, the government's future programs must pay attention to the effectiveness and efficiency of the budget to avoid exacerbating the already strained fiscal situation. The key lies how each government expenditure can optimally enhance economic productivity through increased investment activities, particularly in the manufacturing sector. The 2026 State Budget Law indicates a substantial populist expenditure, namely the Free Nutritious Food program (Rp 335 trillion), the Red and White Village Cooperative (Rp 83 trillion), and public housing (Rp 57.7 trillion). The total of these three flagship programs accounts for 12 percent of the government's total budget. President Prabowo's vision of revitalizing the public consumption sector (demand side) is highly relevant to our economic situation, with its vast number of vulnerable groups. However, without adequate institutional arrangements, such substantial fiscal spending will simply evaporate, while equity deteriorates. The goal of development is not merely to increase growth (welfare), but also to promote justice (justice). Amartya Sen, the 1998 Nobel Prize-winning economic philosopher, once warned that there is no prosperity without justice. We must not allow society to seek its own path to justice, leading to chaos that would undermine the ideals of a Golden Indonesia 2045.</p>

  <h2 style="color:#004aad;font-size:22px;margin-bottom:10px;">Explosion at Harvard Building Affected Small Section of Hallway</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>According to Bernard Mokam, The New York Times (November 2, 2025)</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">The explosion in a building at Harvard Medical School on Saturday affected a small section of a hallway on one floor and inflicted no structural damage to the building, officials of the school said on Sunday.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">The section of hallway, on the fourth floor of the Goldenson Building on the school’s Longwood campus in Boston, has been cleared and is “fully operational,” the officials said, and all labs and equipment in the building “remain intact.” No one was injured in the blast, and the Boston Police Department on Saturday did not find additional explosive devices. Details of the areas affected by the explosion, which the authorities said was intentional, came as local and federal investigators continued their search for two suspects.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">But the Harvard University police said there was not an active threat to the community and that it was safe for students and faculty members to return. The university police have increased their presence on the Longwood campus, the school said, “which we hope will provide an added sense of comfort and security to our community.” The Goldenson Building remained open over the weekend, and cleaning crews worked on Sunday to prepare it for the start of the week, school officials said.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">The explosion, which occurred shortly before 3 a.m. on Saturday, set off a fire alarm, dispatching a university police officer, Steven G. Catalano, a spokesman for the university police, said in a statement. As the officer approached the scene, two people fled from the building. The officer tried to stop them before entering the building, Mr. Catalano said. The Harvard police released still images from video surveillance of the two people they were seeking, asking for the public’s assistance in identifying them. One appeared to wear khaki pants and Crocs and a brown hooded sweatshirt that appeared to say “NYC” on it; the other appeared to wear dark plaid pajama pants and a dark hooded sweatshirt. Both individuals wore light-colored ski masks.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">The building appears to hold portions of the neurobiology department, according to the school’s website. But officials have not indicated what motive, if any, was behind the explosion. The incident is being investigated by the university police and the Boston Field Office of the F.B.I.</p>

  <h2 style="color:#004aad;font-size:22px;margin-bottom:10px;">China’s Xi in The Limelight at Pacific Summit With Trump Conspicuous by His Absence</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>According to Helen Regan, CNN World (November 1, 2025)</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">“We are standing at a critical inflection point with a rapidly changing global economic order,” South Korean president and APEC chair Lee Jae Myung said in his address to the summit Friday. “Only cooperation and solidarity can surely lead us to a better future.” Lee also sat down for talks with Xi, who is on a state visit to South Korea, in the first summit meeting between the two leaders. The two discussed ways to expand cooperation and advance denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula, according to the South Korean presidential office. Ahead of the talks, Lee said the relationship between Seoul and Beijing has “not completely recovered yet” and there was a need to “find the path for helping one another.” He looked forward to China playing a role in promoting peace on the peninsula, Lee said. North Korea called talk of denuclearization a “pipedream” that will never be realized. The country’s Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho accused South Korea of lacking “common sense” for refusing to acknowledge Pyongyang as a nuclear-armed state, the state-run Korea Central News Agency reported Saturday.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Among the high-profile meetings Xi had on the sidelines of APEC was with Japan’s newly installed Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, a staunch conservative who has criticized China’s growing military presence in the region and called for cooperation with Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own. Xi told Takaichi that China was ready to “work with Japan for constructive, stable bilateral ties that meet requirements of the new era,” Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported. “I aim to maintain communication with you and therefore jointly promote the development of China-Japan relations along the right track,” Xi said. Takaichi faced a tough balancing act in her meeting with Xi. China remains Japan’s largest trading partner and Takaichi inherited a country facing mounting economic woes. She told reporters after the meeting that China and Japan agreed to build a “strategic mutually beneficial relationship.” But Takaichi said she also expressed concerns to Xi on sensitive issues including Chinese export controls on rare earths, China’s activity in the East China Sea, and the detention of Japanese nationals in China. “I also asked China to resume Japanese beef and seafood imports,” she said.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">The meeting appeared in stark contrast to the warm camaraderie showed by Takaichi and Trump in Tokyo just days before, when the two allies had embarked on a “new golden age” of relations. Takaichi and Trump demonstrated a close bond complete with smiles, fist pumps and jokes. For Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is involved in an escalating trade war with Trump, meeting with Xi marked a “turning point” in their relationship, according to his office. In an earlier speech that echoed Xi and Lee’s addresses to APEC, Carney told the forum that the world was “facing another hinge moment in history.” “Our world is undergoing one of the most profound shifts since the fall of the Berlin Wall,” he said. “That old world… of steady expansion of liberalized trade and investment… that world is gone.”</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Carney had been looking for a reset of Canada-China relations after years of worsening ties and diplomatic rows. Trade negotiations with the US, Canada’s biggest trading partner, are at a dead end, and Carney said at the APEC summit that he was aiming to double non-US exports over the next decade in an effort to diversify away from the US. The two leaders “affirmed their commitment to renewing the relationship between their two countries in a pragmatic and constructive way” and discussed a framework “to deepen cooperation across a range of areas – from clean and conventional energy, to agriculture, manufacturing, climate change, and international finance,” the prime minister’s office said. Carney also accepted an invitation to visit China and both leaders “directed their officials to move quickly to resolve outstanding trade issues and irritants.”</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Carney said that he had apologized to Trump for a political advertisement that angered the President so much that he terminated trade talks with Canada. “I did apologize to the President,” Carney said when asked by a reporter about the issue on Saturday. “The President was offended by the ad. It’s not something I would have done… which is to put in place that advertisement, and so I apologized to him.” The ad was released last month by the government of Canada’s Ontario province and featured audio from a speech by former US President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs on foreign goods.</p>

  <h2 style="color:#004aad;font-size:22px;margin-bottom:10px;">Worker Trapped For 11 Hours After Collapse of Medieval Tower in Central Rome Dies</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>According to Bill Hutchinson, Phoebe Natanson, Jon Haworth, ABC News (November 4, 2025)</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">A worker who had been trapped for 11 hours in the partial collapse of a medieval tower in the heart of Rome has died after being rescued late Monday, officials said. The 66-year-old man, Octay Stroici, was the last of several workers saved in the rescue operation that was briefly interrupted by a second collapse of the 95-foot-tall Torre de' Conti tower, Luca Cari, a spokesperson for the Rome Fire Service, told ABC News. The man's condition had been reported as critical when rescuers got him down to the ambulance before the drive to the hospital.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">"On behalf of myself and the government, I express my deepest sorrow and condolences for the tragic death of Octay Stroici, the worker who fell victim to the collapse of the Torre dei Conti in Rome," read a statement from Prime Minister Georgia Meloni's office that was released overnight. "Our thoughts are with his family and colleagues at this time of unspeakable grief. I would like to thank once again the rescue workers and all those who worked tirelessly and courageously to try to save his life."</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Before being saved, the trapped worker was conscious and communicating with search-and-rescue crews, Cari said. About 140 firefighters responded to the scene, some digging with their bare hands to free the worker.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri told reporters on Monday evening, just before the last rescue was made, that doctors had reached the worker and supplied him with oxygen. No firefighters were injured in the incident, officials said. The tower is in the historic part of central Rome near the Roman Forum and the Colosseum.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cari said the emergency unfolded around 11 a.m. local time. At the time of the first collapse, 11 workers from two companies were working on the tower. "It all happened suddenly," one of the workers told Italy's ANSA news agency. "Then I only saw the cloud of dust and the rescuers." Cari said the second partial collapse occurred about an hour after the first, while firefighters were attempting to rescue the workers.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">At least three other workers were pulled from the rubble, two of them unharmed, officials said. One rescued worker, a 64-year-old man, was taken to a hospital with a head injury, officials said. The cause of the collapse remains under investigation. The tower has been closed to the public since 2007, but recently received a large grant from Italy's National Recovery and Resilience Plan for the renovation, officials said. The Torre dei Conti tower, which dates back to the 13th century, was built by Pope Innocent III as a residence for his family.</p>
