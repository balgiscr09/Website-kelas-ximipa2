    <h2 style="color:#004aad;font-size:22px;margin-bottom:10px;">Government Launches SIMBARA for Mining Transparency</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>According to Datafaogo Stevanus, RRI Voice of Indonesia (November 5, 2025)</em></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs held the Kick-Off Implementation of Presidential Regulation Number 94 Year 2025 on Integrated Digital Services for Mineral and Coal Commodities (SIMBARA) in Jakarta, Wednesday (10/29/2025). The implementation marks a milestone in strengthening governance and optimizing state revenue from the mineral and coal sector.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">“Through SIMBARA, the government builds an integrated digital service system connecting data, policies, and supervision,” the ministry's Deputy for Energy and Mineral Resources Coordination, Elen Setiadi, conveyed. The system aims to ensure transparency and compliance among business actors in the mineral and coal sector. As quoted by the Ministry's Press Release on Tuesday (11/4/2025), SIMBARA implementation involves not only digital system integration but also cross-sector policy alignment. Each Ministry or Institution is urged to prepare concrete action plans for effective execution.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In 2025, SIMBARA will focus on five main commodities: coal, nickel, tin, bauxite, and copper. The Auto Blocking System will sanction companies violating environmental, forest area, or labor regulations. The initial implementation, since 2022, has improved compliance in state revenue payments. Several ministries support the expansion in 2025, including the Environment, Forestry, Transportation, and Industry ministries.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) includes SIMBARA in Action 8 of the National Strategy of Corruption Prevention for 2025-2026. Bank Indonesia also supports the integration of export foreign exchange supervision within the system. Deputy Elen underscored the need for rapid collaboration among ministries to meet this year’s targets. He also added that technical meetings with four key ministries will finalize SIMBARA’s integration and governance for copper and bauxite commodities.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#004aad;font-size:22px;margin-bottom:10px;">UNESCO Has Designated Raja Ampat as A World Biosphere Reserve</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>According to TEMPO (September 27, 2025)</em></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) designated Raja Ampat as a world biosphere reserve on Saturday, September 27, 2025. The area in Southwest Papua Province is considered to have a marine ecosystem with the highest biodiversity in the world.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Head of the West Papua Natural Resources Conservation Agency, Johny Santoso, stated that Papua's land conservation is strongly supported by the local wisdom of indigenous communities, particularly those in Raja Ampat Regency. "'The forest is mother, the sea is father,' is the spirit of the Raja Ampat people to protect their forests and their seas," he said during the proposal for the Raja Ampat Biosphere Reserve in Waisai on September 24, 2024, as recorded in a UNESCO release received by Tempo.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">According to Johny, there are nine conservation areas in Raja Ampat Regency that are managed collaboratively by indigenous communities, local and central governments, non-governmental organizations, academics, and other stakeholders. These nine areas form the core of the Raja Ampat Biosphere Reserve.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">After being designated a UNESCO Global Geopark in 2023, Raja Ampat is now also recognized as a biosphere reserve. With this dual status, Raja Ampat joins the very limited number of regions worldwide to receive dual UNESCO recognition.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#004aad;font-size:22px;margin-bottom:10px;">Antarctic Glacier’s Rapid Retreat Sparks Scientific ‘Whodunnit’</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>According to Mark Poynting, BBC (November 3, 2025)</em></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When an Antarctic glacier was sparked into rapid retreat three years ago, it left scientists scratching their heads as to what might have caused it. Hektoria Glacier retreated by more than 8km (5 miles) in just two months in late 2022 - and now a new study claims to have the answer. The authors believe that Hektoria could be the first modern example of a process where the front of a glacier resting on the seabed rapidly destabilises.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">That could lead to much faster sea-level rise if it happened elsewhere in Antarctica, they say. But other scientists argue that this part of the glacier was actually floating in the ocean – so while the changes are impressive, they are not so unusual. Floating tongues of glaciers extending into the sea – called ice shelves – are much more prone to breaking up than glacier fronts resting on the seabed. That's because they can be more easily eaten away by warm water underneath.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">That Hektoria has undergone huge change is not contested. Its front retreated by about 25km (16 miles) between January 2022 and March 2023, satellite data shows. But unravelling the causes is like a "whodunnit" mystery, according to study lead author Naomi Ochwat, research affiliate at the University of Colorado Boulder and post-doctoral researcher at the University of Innsbruck.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In just two months, Hektoria retreated by 8.2km — nearly ten times faster than any grounded glacier recorded before. Upward forces from the ocean water could "lift" the thinning ice essentially all at once, they argue - causing icebergs to break off and the glacier to retreat in quick time. "Glaciers don't usually retreat this fast," said co-author Adrian Luckman, professor of geography at Swansea University.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">While researchers debate the mechanisms, all agree on one thing: Antarctica is changing faster than expected. “We must collect more data from satellites so that we can better monitor and understand why these changes are occurring and what their implications are,” said Anna Hogg, professor of Earth observation at the University of Leeds.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#004aad;font-size:22px;margin-bottom:10px;">Airbus to Open Airframe Assembly Line in Indonesia</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>According to Tempo (November 4, 2025)</em></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Airbus, the European aerospace company, is set to open an airframe assembly line in Indonesia in collaboration with PT Dirgantara Indonesia (PTDI). This partnership aims to strengthen Indonesia’s position in the global aviation supply chain while boosting the domestic aerospace industry.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The collaboration was formalized through a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed by PTDI and Airbus representatives in Jakarta. The new assembly line will focus on producing aircraft components for Airbus’s commercial fleet, including the A320 and A220 families, with the potential for future expansion to other models.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Minister of State-Owned Enterprises, Erick Thohir, said this cooperation demonstrates Indonesia’s growing technological capability. “This is not just about assembling aircraft but transferring knowledge and technology to develop Indonesia’s aerospace manufacturing ecosystem,” Erick stated. He emphasized that the project would create high-skilled jobs and attract global investment to the country.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, PTDI President Director Gita Amperiawan expressed optimism about the partnership’s potential impact on regional aviation. “Our engineers and facilities are ready to meet Airbus’s international standards,” he said. Production is expected to begin in 2026, with the facility located in Bandung, West Java. Airbus has also committed to training PTDI personnel in France and Germany.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#004aad;font-size:22px;margin-bottom:10px;">Indonesia to Introduce New Fiscal Incentives for Electric Vehicle Industry</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>According to Kompas (November 2, 2025)</em></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Indonesian government will soon introduce new fiscal incentives to attract investment in the electric vehicle (EV) industry. The incentives will include tax breaks for EV manufacturers and component suppliers, aiming to accelerate the country's transition toward green mobility.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Minister of Finance Sri Mulyani Indrawati announced that the incentives are designed to support President Joko Widodo’s vision of making Indonesia a major EV hub in Southeast Asia. “We are finalizing a comprehensive fiscal package to make the EV ecosystem more competitive and sustainable,” she stated. The measures will complement ongoing non-fiscal policies, such as simplified licensing and import duty exemptions for EV components.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Under the new scheme, companies investing in EV battery production, electric buses, and charging infrastructure will receive significant tax deductions. “Our priority is to encourage domestic production while reducing reliance on imported components,” Sri Mulyani added. The government also plans to strengthen local partnerships with universities and research centers to develop EV-related technology.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Industry experts predict that with these incentives, Indonesia could attract over USD 10 billion in new investments over the next five years, particularly from Japan, South Korea, and China. However, environmental groups have urged the government to ensure that nickel mining — a key resource for EV batteries — adheres to strict sustainability standards.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#004aad;font-size:22px;margin-bottom:10px;">Harvard Researchers Develop AI to Predict Future Pandemics</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>According to The Guardian (November 1, 2025)</em></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Scientists at Harvard University have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model capable of predicting potential pandemic outbreaks by analyzing patterns in global disease data. The system, named “PandemAI,” uses machine learning to monitor real-time reports from health organizations, social media, and environmental sensors.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Lead researcher Dr. Emily Zhao stated that the model has already identified several potential viral hotspots in Asia and Africa. “Our goal is early detection — stopping the next pandemic before it spreads,” she explained. The AI cross-references biological, environmental, and socioeconomic factors to identify areas most at risk of zoonotic disease transmission.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike traditional epidemiological systems, PandemAI continuously learns and adapts to new data sources. It can also simulate possible transmission scenarios, helping governments prepare targeted containment strategies. “With PandemAI, we can model outbreaks months in advance,” Zhao said. “It’s not just about prediction — it’s about prevention.”</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Public health experts have praised the system as a potential game-changer but emphasized the importance of data transparency and international cooperation. The researchers are now collaborating with the World Health Organization (WHO) and several national health agencies to integrate PandemAI into global monitoring networks by 2026.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#004aad;font-size:22px;margin-bottom:10px;">Rome Tower Becomes Europe’s Tallest Wooden Skyscraper</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>According to Reuters (October 30, 2025)</em></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Rome has made architectural history by completing Europe’s tallest wooden skyscraper — a 120-meter eco-friendly structure known as “The Eterna Tower.” The project reflects Italy’s growing commitment to sustainable urban design and renewable construction materials.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The tower, located in the EUR business district, was designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano and constructed using cross-laminated timber (CLT), a material celebrated for its strength and environmental benefits. It houses residential units, offices, and green rooftop spaces that absorb CO₂ emissions from the surrounding area.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">“This tower proves that modern architecture can coexist with sustainability,” said Rome’s mayor, Maria Conti, during the inauguration ceremony. “We hope this will inspire other European cities to follow the same path.” According to Conti, the building’s energy-efficient systems will reduce overall consumption by 40% compared to conventional high-rises.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Experts have praised the Eterna Tower for setting a new benchmark in carbon-neutral construction. The building’s wooden frame stores over 5,000 tons of CO₂, equivalent to the emissions produced by 3,000 cars in a year. Future developments in Rome’s skyline are expected to adopt similar designs, reinforcing the city’s reputation as a pioneer in green architecture.</p>
