          <h4 style="margin-bottom: 8px">Sangkuriang and Dayang Sumbi</h4>

          <p><strong>Orientation:</strong></p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Once upon a time, in the land of Priangan, lived a family with a
            unique story. The father was not an ordinary man but a dog named
            Tumang, who was actually a cursed god. The mother, a beautiful and
            kind woman, was called Dayang Sumbi, and together they had a son
            named Sangkuriang.
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            One day, Dayang Sumbi asked her son to go hunting in the forest,
            accompanied by his faithful dog, Tumang. They spent the whole day
            searching for deer, but not even a single one appeared. Growing
            frustrated and desperate, Sangkuriang began to lose patience. In his
            anger, he made a terrible decision. He killed his own dog, Tumang,
            and took its liver home, pretending it was deer liver.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Complication:</strong></p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            At home, Dayang Sumbi prepared to cook the meat. But soon, she
            discovered the truth. The liver did not belong to a deer but to
            Tumang, her loyal companion. Realizing what Sangkuriang had done,
            Dayang Sumbi was furious. In her rage, she struck Sangkuriang’s head
            with a rice scoop, leaving a deep wound. The boy, hurt both
            physically and emotionally, left home in anger and sorrow.
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Years passed, Sangkuriang grew into a strong and handsome young man.
            He wandered across kingdoms, traveling to many places, until one
            day, he returned unknowingly to his homeland. In a village, he met a
            beautiful woman. They quickly fell in love and decided to marry.
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            However, as they discussed their wedding plans, Dayang Sumbi, who
            was still youthful and beautiful because of her divine powers,
            noticed the scar on the young man’s forehead. It looked exactly like
            the wound she had once inflicted on her son. Shocked and horrified,
            she realized that the man she was about to marry was none other than
            her own son, Sangkuriang.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Resolution:</strong></p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Dayang Sumbi knew she could not marry Sangkuriang, but she also
            could not directly reveal the truth. To delay the marriage, she gave
            Sangkuriang an impossible task. He had to build a great lake and a
            huge boat in just one night, before the sun rose.
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Driven by love and determination, Sangkuriang used his supernatural
            powers. He summoned spirits and worked tirelessly. By midnight, the
            lake was almost finished, and the giant boat was nearly complete.
            Dayang Sumbi grew anxious, fearing that Sangkuriang would succeed.
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            In desperation, she prayed for divine help. Then, she spread pieces
            of silk cloth across the eastern horizon and created the illusion of
            dawn. Roosters began to crow, thinking morning had come. Seeing
            this, Sangkuriang thought he had failed.
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Furious and heartbroken, he kicked the giant boat with all his
            strength. The unfinished boat toppled over, landing upside down, and
            magically turned into a mountain. To this day, that mountain is
            known as Tangkuban Perahu, which means “upturned boat,” located in
            Bandung, West Java.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Re-orientation:</strong></p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            The story of Sangkuriang and Dayang Sumbi teaches us that lies and
            disobedience can lead to great tragedy. It also reminds us of the
            importance of patience and respecting those who care for us. In the
            end, greed and anger only bring destruction, while wisdom and
            sincerity bring peace.

            <em>Introduction/Thesis :</em> The integration of Artificial
            Intelligence (AI) into the workplace has transformed industries,
            improving efficiency and productivity. However, the deployment of AI
            also raises ethical and economic concerns that warrant careful
            examination.

          <p><em>Arguments:</em></p>
          <ul style="margin-left: 20px">
            <li>
              On the positive side, AI streamlines tasks, increasing
              productivity and allowing employees to focus on more complex
              responsibilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              However, the automation of jobs by AI poses a threat to

              economic disparities.

            Borobudur is a Buddhist temple located in Magelang, Central Java,
            Indonesia. It was built in the ninth century and is well-known
            around the world. The temple consists of eight stone terraces: the
            first five are square and surrounded by walls with Buddhist
            sculptures, and the upper three are circular. The entire structure
            is crowned by a large stupa at the very top.
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            The design of Borobudur symbolizes the conception of the universe in
            Buddhist cosmology. It is believed that the universe is divided into
            three spiritual spheres, kamadhatu, rupadhatu, and arupadhatu. The
            first sphere, kamadhatu, represents respectively the sphere of
            desires where we are bound to our desires; the second sphere,
            rupadhatu, represents forms where we abandon our desires but are
            still bound to name and form; and the last sphere, arupadhatu,
            represents formlessness where there is no longer either name or
            form. Borobudur temple which was rededicated as an Indonesian
            monument in 1983 is a valuable treasure for Indonesian people. With
            its magnificent size and architecture, no wonder that Borobudur
            Temple includes 7 wonders of the world.
