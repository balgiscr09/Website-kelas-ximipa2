            How to Stop Bullying in This School

          <h3 style="color: #333; margin-bottom: 10px">What is Bullying?</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            You can usually identify bullying through the following three
            characteristics: intent, repetition, and power. A person who bullies
            intends to cause pain, either through physical harm or hurtful words
            or behavior, and does so repeatedly. Boys are more likely to
            experience physical bullying, while girls are more likely to
            experience psychological bullying. Bullying can happen both in
            person or online. Cyberbullying often occurs over social media,
            SMS/text or instant message, email, or any online platform where
            children interact.

            The Shadow of Bullying in Indonesia’s Education System

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Behind the veil of Indonesian education, a deep wound persists,
            affecting the younger generation: bullying. This phenomenon is a
            parasite, making kids feel unsafe and inflicting deep trauma on
            them.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            A 2022 study by the Ministry of Education and Culture found that
            36.31% of students could be experiencing bullying, whether through
            words, actions, or online. However, only 13.54% felt brave enough to
            speak up about it. The United Federation of Indonesian Teachers
            (FGSI) recorded an increase in bullying cases from 21 cases in 2022
            to 30 in 2023. Meanwhile, the Indonesian Child Protection Commission
            (KPAI) reported 87 bullying cases out of 2,355 total reports of
            child abuse.

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Recent violent incidents at schools, including the tragic death of a
            student at an Islamic boarding school, have highlighted the urgent
            need for preventive action. Schools should be safe spaces for
            learning, not environments for fear and harm.

            at UM Surabaya, explained that bullying is an intentional and
            repeated act that intimidates or threatens victims.

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            She emphasized that bullying can cause victims to lose confidence,
            develop anxiety or depression, and even have suicidal thoughts.
            Victims may also experience academic decline and social withdrawal.
            Perpetrators, on the other hand, risk becoming aggressive and
            antisocial if left unchecked.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Uswatun called on parents, schools, and the government to strengthen

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Support victims: Show kindness and don’t join in or laugh at the
            bully’s actions. Include victims in activities to help them feel
            less alone.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Don’t respond with hate: Stay calm and avoid arguing, as reacting
            gives them control.
