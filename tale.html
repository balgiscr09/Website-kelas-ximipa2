    <h2 style="color:#004aad;font-size:22px;margin-bottom:10px;">A Lil Dog Plush</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic;color: #555;margin-bottom: 12px;">written by: Klarisa Satyadhistana & Felicia Ni Putu Bianca Muryantana</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved her plush dog more than anything else. The plush’s name was “Buddy.” It was soft, fluffy, and always there when she felt lonely or sad.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">One day, Lily brought Buddy to the park. She played with her friends, laughing and running around — but when she returned to her bag, Buddy was gone! Lily panicked. She looked under benches, behind the trees, and even asked the park keeper, but Buddy was nowhere to be found.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Heartbroken, Lily walked home crying. That night, she prayed that whoever found Buddy would take good care of him. The next morning, her mom showed her a message on the neighborhood chat: “Found: a small brown dog plush at City Park.” Lily’s heart jumped with joy. She and her mom rushed to the park office, and there it was — Buddy! Cleaned, hugged, and waiting for her.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Lily promised to never lose Buddy again. From that day, she kept him close, and every time she saw him, she remembered how kindness and honesty still exist in the world.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#004aad;font-size:22px;margin-bottom:10px;">The Bird and The Whale</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic;color: #555;margin-bottom: 12px;">written by: Emily Couture</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Once there was a bird that loved to fly high in the sky, and a whale that loved to swim deep in the ocean. One day, they met at the surface of the water. The bird was resting on a rock, and the whale came up for air.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">“Hello there!” said the bird. “Wow, you’re so big!” The whale smiled and replied, “And you’re so small! But you can fly — something I’ve always dreamed of.”</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">They became friends and shared stories every day. The bird told tales of mountains, trees, and clouds, while the whale spoke of coral reefs and sunken ships. They admired each other’s world, even though they were so different.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">One stormy night, the bird couldn’t visit the whale, and the whale couldn’t rise to the surface. Both were sad and missed each other dearly. But when the storm ended, they met again under a bright rainbow. “We may live in different worlds,” said the whale, “but friendship connects us.”</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">From then on, they promised to always meet when the sea was calm — reminding us that true friendship knows no boundaries.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#004aad;font-size:22px;margin-bottom:10px;">The Princess and The Pea</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic;color: #555;margin-bottom: 12px;">written by: Hans Christian Andersen</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Once upon a time, there was a prince who wanted to marry a real princess. He traveled around the world to find one, but every princess he met didn’t seem real enough. Some were too proud, some were too quiet, and some didn’t have true royal manners.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">One night, during a heavy storm, there was a knock at the castle gate. When the servant opened it, a young woman stood there — soaked with rain, trembling from the cold. “I’m a princess,” she said softly, “and I’ve lost my way.”</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">The queen wasn’t so sure. “We’ll see about that,” she thought. She placed a single pea under twenty mattresses and twenty feather beds where the girl would sleep that night. The next morning, the queen asked, “Did you sleep well, dear?”</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">“Oh, terribly!” said the girl. “Something hard was under the bed all night. I couldn’t sleep at all!” The queen and the prince looked at each other — only a real princess could feel a pea through so many layers. The prince smiled, for he had finally found his true princess.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">They married soon after, and the pea was placed in a museum, where it can still be seen today — if no one has taken it!</p>

    <h2 style="color:#004aad;font-size:22px;margin-bottom:10px;">Ella Enchanted</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic;color: #555;margin-bottom: 12px;">written by: Tommy O’Haver, Susan Miller, Jane Startz</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Once upon a time in the kingdom of Frell, there lived a girl named Ella. When she was a baby, a fairy named Lucinda gave her a “gift” — the gift of obedience. It meant that Ella had to obey every order she was given, no matter what. At first, it seemed harmless, but as Ella grew older, it became a curse.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">When her mother passed away, Ella’s father remarried a cruel woman with two mean daughters. They discovered Ella’s secret and started giving her awful commands. “Clean this floor!” “Give me your necklace!” “Don’t talk!” Ella was heartbroken, but she never lost her spirit. She promised herself that one day she would break free.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">One day, Ella met Prince Char, the kind and handsome prince of the land. They became close friends, and soon, he fell deeply in love with her. But Ella was afraid — what if someone ordered her to harm him? So, she ran away and began her journey to find Lucinda, the fairy who cursed her.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">After many challenges, Ella finally met Lucinda and begged her to lift the curse. Lucinda laughed and said, “You must free yourself.” When Prince Char proposed to her, Ella’s heart ached. She wanted to say yes, but her curse made her hesitate. Then she realized — love gives strength, not weakness. “No one can command me anymore!” she shouted. And at that moment, the spell was broken.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Ella married Prince Char and became a wise and free queen. Her courage showed that true strength comes from within.</p>

  <article style="margin-bottom:40px;">
    <h2 style="color:#004aad;font-size:22px;margin-bottom:10px;">The Marvellous Musician</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic;color: #555;margin-bottom: 12px;"></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Once there was a clever musician who traveled from town to town, playing his violin for everyone to hear. One day, as he walked through a dark forest, he felt lonely. “Ah,” he said to himself, “I could use a companion.” So he played a cheerful tune on his violin, hoping someone would come.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Before long, a wolf appeared. “Hello, musician,” said the wolf. “I’d love to come with you.” But the musician didn’t want a dangerous wolf around, so he said, “If you can play the violin like me, you may join.” He handed the wolf a violin, but of course, the wolf couldn’t play. “Then tie your paw to this tree and practice,” said the musician — and he ran away while the wolf was stuck!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Later, he played again, and a fox appeared. “May I come with you?” asked the fox. “If you can play the violin,” replied the musician. The fox tried but failed, so the musician tricked him too — tying his tail to a branch and escaping again.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Finally, a little rabbit hopped up. “Can I join you?” it asked. The musician smiled and decided to be kind this time. He taught the rabbit to dance to his music, and together they continued their journey — one playing, the other hopping joyfully.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">But soon, the wolf and the fox escaped and chased after them. When they caught up, they were furious. Just then, a woodcutter appeared with his axe. Seeing him, the wolf and fox fled back into the woods. The musician thanked the woodcutter and continued on his way, happy with his new little friend who truly loved music.</p>

  <article style="margin-bottom:40px;">
    <h2 style="color:#004aad;font-size:22px;margin-bottom:10px;">Aladdin and The Magic Lamp</h2>
    <p style="font-style: italic;color: #555;margin-bottom: 12px;"></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Once upon a time, in the city of Agrabah, there lived a poor young man named Aladdin. He lived with his mother in a small house and spent his days dreaming of adventure. One day, a mysterious sorcerer came to him, pretending to be his long-lost uncle. He promised Aladdin great riches if he helped retrieve an old lamp hidden deep in a cave.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">When they reached the cave, the sorcerer gave Aladdin a magic ring and said, “Bring me the lamp, and you shall be rewarded.” Aladdin found the lamp, but as soon as he handed it over, the cave began to collapse! The sorcerer ran away, trapping Aladdin inside.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">In despair, Aladdin rubbed the magic ring — and to his surprise, a powerful genie appeared! The genie helped him escape the cave, and Aladdin kept the lamp for himself. Curious, he rubbed the lamp — and another, even greater genie appeared. “I am the Genie of the Lamp,” it said. “Your wish is my command.”</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">With the genie’s help, Aladdin became rich and built a magnificent palace. He met and fell in love with Princess Jasmine, and they married with the Sultan’s blessing. But the sorcerer soon returned, disguised as a merchant, and tricked the princess into giving him the lamp. Once he had it, he commanded the genie to move the palace far away to his land.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">Aladdin, with the help of the ring genie, traveled to rescue his wife and defeat the sorcerer. When he finally reclaimed the lamp, he wished for the genie’s freedom. The genie, grateful for Aladdin’s kindness, granted him a happy and prosperous life forever after.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">And so, Aladdin and Jasmine lived happily ever after, reminding us that true wealth lies not in gold, but in courage and a kind heart.</p>
